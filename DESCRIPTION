Description: Morphometric data collected on animal populations can be
    subject to measurement error, which leads to biased estimators
    using line-fitting techniques such as linear regression and
    reduced major axis. The models implemented in this package
    explicitly accommodate measurement error, allow for multivariate
    data, estimate relationships between dimensions, and provide tests
    for isometric relationships between dimensions. Morphometric data
    of the reef manta ray, collected in Raja Ampat, Indonesia, are
    included.
