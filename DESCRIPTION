Description: Morphometric data collected on animal populations can be
    subject to measurement error, which leads to biased estimators
    using line-fitting techniques such as linear regression and
    reduced major axis. The models implemented in this package
    explicitly accommodate measurement error, allow for multivariate
    data, and provide tests for isometric relationships between
    dimensions. Morphometric data of the reef manta ray, collected in
    Raja Ampat, Indonesia, are included.
