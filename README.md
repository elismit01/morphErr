# `morphErr`: Measurement error models for morphometric data

Morphometric data collected on animal populations can be subject to measurement error, which leads to biased estimators using line-fitting techniques such as linear regression and reduced major axis. The models implemented in this package explicitly accommodate measurement error, allow for multivariate data, estimate relationships between dimensions, and provide tests for isometric relationships between dimensions. Morphometric data of the reef manta ray, collected in Raja Ampat, Indonesia, are included.

## Installation

After installing the `remotes` package, `morphErr` can be installed using the following line of code:

```R
install_github("elismit01/morphErr")
