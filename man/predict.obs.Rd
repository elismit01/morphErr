\title{Predict from Observed Measurements}
\usage{
\method{predict}{obs}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object from fit.morph()}

\item{...}{Additional arguments:
\itemize{
\item true: A vector of true dimension measurements. Set elements to NA for dimensions to predict
\item obs: A matrix of observed measurements with error, where each row represents measurements
from one photograph. NA values allowed for missing measurements.
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predictions for all dimensions
}
\description{
Makes predictions by combining prior information with observed measurements that contain error.
