\title{Simulate Morphometric Measurements}
\usage{
sim.measurements(n.animals, n.photos, m, mus, sigmas, rhos, psis, phis)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.animals}{Integer. The number of animals in the sample.}

\item{n.photos}{Integer vector. If there are \code{n.animals} elements,
each one specifies the number of photos for an individual. If
there is one element, then that number of photos is used for
all animals.}

\item{m}{Integer. The number of dimensions.}

\item{mus}{A vector with \code{m} elements providing the means of the
true dimension sizes in the population.}

\item{sigmas}{A vector with \code{m} elements providing the standard
deviations for true dimension sizes in the population.}

\item{rhos}{A vector, with one element for each pair of dimensions,
providing the pairwise correlations between true dimension
sizes in the population. See 'Details' for the correct order
for the correlations.}

\item{psis}{A vector with \code{m} elements, providing the standard
deviations of measurement errors for the dimensions.}

\item{phis}{A vector, with one element for each pair of dimensions,
providing the pairwise correlations between measurement errors
for the dimensions. See 'Details' for the correct order for the
correlations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with four columns:
\describe{

\item{\code{animal.id}}{An individual identification number. Rows
with the same \code{animal.id} correspond to
measurements of the same individual.}

\item{\code{photo.id}}{A photo identification number. Rows with
the same \code{photo.id} correspond to
measurements taken from the same image.}

\item{\code{dim}}{An integer indicating the dimension the
measurement is for.}

\item{\code{measurement}}{The observed measurement value.}

}
}
\description{
Simulates morphometric data from a photogrammetry survey, with
observations subject to measurement error, under the model
described by \href{../doc/model.pdf}{Stevenson, Smit, and Setyawan
(in submission)}.
}
\details{
For arguments \code{rhos} and \code{phis}, the elements must be
ordered so that all \eqn{m - 1} correlations involving
dimension 1 appear first in ascending numerical order, followed
by all remaining \eqn{m - 2} correlations involving dimension
2, and so on.

For example, if \code{m = 4}, then the first three elements are the
correlations between dimension 1 and dimensions 2, 3, and 4,
respectively. The following two elements are correlations between
dimension 2 and dimensions 3 and 4, respectively. The final element
is the correlation between dimension 3 and 4.

## three dimensions.

                         psis = c(10, 6, 4),
                         phis = c(0.5, 0.4, 0.3))
