\title{Predict measurements for morphometric data}
\usage{
\method{predict}{lme.morph}(
  object,
  true_measurements = NULL,
  observed_measurements = NULL,
  y.dim,
  type = c("lm", "pca"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object from fit.morph()}

\item{true_measurements}{A data frame of true measurements to predict from, with column names
of the form "dimX" where X is the dimension number, or NULL}

\item{observed_measurements}{A matrix of observed measurements with error, where each row
represents measurements from one photograph, or NULL. NA values allowed for missing
measurements.}

\item{y.dim}{Which dimension to predict}

\item{type}{Either "lm" or "pca" for prediction type (only used with true measurements)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods}
}
\value{
A matrix with Estimate and Std.Error columns
}
\description{
Makes predictions based on either true measurements or observed measurements with error.
Users must provide either true_measurements or observed_measurements, not both.
}
