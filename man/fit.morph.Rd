\title{Fit Morphometric Model}
\usage{
fit.morph(data, method = "REML", intercept = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing:
\itemize{
\item animal.id: factor indicating which animal the measurement is from
\item photo.id: factor indicating which photo the measurement is from
\item dim: factor indicating which dimension is measured
\item measurement: the observed morphometric measurement
}}

\item{method}{Character, either "ML" for maximum likelihood or "REML" for
restricted maximum likelihood}

\item{intercept}{Logical, whether to include an intercept in fixed effects}
}
\value{
An object of class "lme.morph" containing:
\itemize{
\item coefficients: Model coefficients
\item vcov: Variance-covariance matrix
\item residuals: Model residuals
\item fitted: Fitted values
}
}
\description{
Fits a linear mixed-effects model to morphometric data accounting for measurement error.
